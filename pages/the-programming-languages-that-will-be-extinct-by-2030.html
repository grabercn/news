      <h2>Article</h2>
      <p>As technology advances at a rapid pace, the world of programming languages is also constantly evolving. Some languages that were once widely used are now facing the risk of becoming extinct by 2030. Let's take a closer look at a few programming languages that may fade into obscurity in the coming years.

One of the languages that could face extinction is COBOL. Developed in the late 1950s, COBOL was primarily used for business, finance, and administrative systems. However, with the rise of more modern and versatile languages like Python and Java, COBOL has seen a decline in popularity. As older systems are updated or replaced, the need for COBOL programmers is diminishing, potentially leading to its extinction by 2030.

Another language that may become obsolete is Perl. Known for its text processing capabilities and powerful regex support, Perl was once a popular choice for web development and system administration. However, with the emergence of languages like Python, Ruby, and JavaScript that offer more modern features and better performance, Perl has been losing its relevance in the programming world.

Additionally, languages like Visual Basic and Delphi are also at risk of becoming extinct by 2030. These languages were popular choices for developing Windows desktop applications, but with the shift towards web and mobile development, their usage has declined significantly. Developers are now opting for languages that are better suited for modern application development, leading to the gradual decline of Visual Basic and Delphi.

While these languages may be on the path to extinction, it's important to note that the programming landscape is constantly changing. New languages are being developed, and existing languages are being updated to meet the demands of evolving technology. As we look ahead to 2030, it's clear that the programming languages that stand the test of time will be those that can adapt to the ever-changing tech industry landscape.</p>
