      <p>In a world driven by data and technology, a new concept has emerged to shift the focus back to what truly matters - human connection. People Intelligence, also known as PQ (People Quotient), is the ability to understand, communicate, and connect with others on a deeper level. Just as IQ measures cognitive intelligence and EQ measures emotional intelligence, PQ delves into the realm of interpersonal relationships and social dynamics.

People Intelligence goes beyond mere social skills; it encompasses empathy, intuition, and the capacity to navigate complex human interactions effectively. It involves being attuned to non-verbal cues, understanding different communication styles, and adapting one's approach to connect authentically with diverse individuals. By honing their People Intelligence, individuals can build stronger relationships, resolve conflicts more effectively, and collaborate more productively in both personal and professional settings.
