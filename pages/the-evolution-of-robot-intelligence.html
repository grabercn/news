      <p>Robots have come a long way since their inception, evolving from simple machines carrying out predefined tasks to intelligent beings capable of making complex decisions. The field of robot intelligence has seen remarkable progress, thanks to advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning.

At the core of robot intelligence lies the ability to perceive and interact with the environment. Early robots were limited to following programmed instructions or reacting to specific stimuli. However, with the integration of sensors such as cameras, lidar, and radar, modern robots can gather vast amounts of data about their surroundings in real-time.

Artificial intelligence plays a crucial role in enabling robots to process this sensory information and make sense of it. Machine learning algorithms allow robots to learn from experience, adapt to new situations, and improve their performance over time. This capability is particularly evident in autonomous vehicles, where robots need to navigate complex road systems and make split-second decisions to ensure passenger safety.

One of the key challenges in robot intelligence is developing the ability for robots to understand and respond to human emotions. Social robots, designed to interact with</p>
