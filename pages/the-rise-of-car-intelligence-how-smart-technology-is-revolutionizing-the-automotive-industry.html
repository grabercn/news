      <p>In recent years, the automotive industry has witnessed a remarkable transformation with the integration of smart technology into vehicles, giving rise to the concept of car intelligence. From self-driving cars to advanced safety features and interactive infotainment systems, smart technology is revolutionizing the way we interact with our vehicles.

One of the most significant advancements in car intelligence is the development of autonomous or self-driving cars. These vehicles are equipped with a network of sensors, cameras, and artificial intelligence systems that enable them to navigate roads, detect obstacles, and make decisions without human intervention. While fully autonomous cars are still in the testing phase, semi-autonomous features such as adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist, and automatic parking are already available in many modern vehicles.

Safety is another key area where car intelligence is making a profound impact. Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) use sensors and cameras to monitor the vehicle's surroundings and alert the driver to potential hazards. Features such as automatic emergency braking, blind-spot detection</p>
